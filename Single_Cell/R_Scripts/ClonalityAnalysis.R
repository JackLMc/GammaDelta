# A script to investigate the clonality of the cells gained from Mike Stubbington analyses

### Clonality values for each cell were calculated by looking for the TraCeR-derived TCR sequences in the iRepertoire data (represented as percentages).
### It's not entirely obvious which metric we should use to define a single 'clonality score' for a cell given that there are two loci but they are not always detected by TraCeR in every cell. 
### In reality it probably doesn't make a huge amount of difference.

### Since we only have four of interest we can also do the 2 vs 2 comparisons. Not sure how useful these will be.
### Since each group here contains half of the clonotype classes we can just do three comparisons and include both negative and positive markers. So, for clonotype_AE_markers the positive markers will be the ones up in both A and E whilst the negative markers will be the ones up in J and K.
